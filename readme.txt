Name :- Ajinkya Kishor Vadane
README:

I have implemented the codes using Python version 3.6 on Pycharm.
Used various libraries for plotting graph and label encoding.
such as 
matplotlib.pyplot
and numpy
I have not used predefined libraries for calulating probabilities and same estimating 
euclidean distance

Code running instructions:-
Question 1 (Kmeans)
1)Run the code mykmeans_Q1.py
2)Enter the number of clusters
3) Enter the centroids one by one 
example:-
Enter the Number of Clusters: 4
Enter coordinates: 10 10
Enter coordinates: 10 -10
Enter coordinates: -10 10
Enter coordinates: -10 -10

Question 2 
1)Run the code mykde_Q2.py
